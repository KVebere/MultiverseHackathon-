Entry for the IT society hackathon.

Hackathon description and prompt:
Backstory
In a galaxy far, far away, known as the Land of Epic Multiverses, an unprecedented calamity struck! The magical Infinity Sword, forged in the fires of Mordor, accidentally teleported across dimensions and landed in Hogwarts during a Quidditch match. As a result, characters from various realms - from Jedi Knights to Asgardian warriors, from wizards to dragon tamers - found themselves intertwined in an uproarious cosmic mix-up! To restore order and ensure harmony among the realms, these characters must come together through a solution that connects their distinct universes!

Problem Statement
The interdimensional chaos has led to perplexing situations! Jon Snow from the Night's Watch is casting spells, Hermione Granger has traded her wand for a lightsaber, and Gandalf the Grey is in a heated debate with Iron Man about the best way to save Middle-earth. The lack of a common platform for these legendary figures to communicate, coordinate, and understand each other's worlds has caused hilarious mayhem!
